The application rTracker.py generates an HTML document that can be viewed/printed from a browser.  The intent is to be able to keep track of resources.  The application will process a directory containing image files (file.<jpg|JPG>) and a description of the image file named (file.txt).  Each image file can have an associated file which contains necessary information describing the image file.

If a file does not exist, the image will be presented without any associated information.

The content of the description txt file is as following blocks:
Image Description File: <base filename same as image, but "txt" extension>
1) <detailed description, etc>
2) <estimated cost:"$" > cost (blank with no owner means liquidate)
3) <owner:"@" > name (blank means no one claims ownership, double "@@" means BOTH)
4) <tracking number(s):"#" > track number (must have owner specified, each tracking number is in own row)

Value			Owner		Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-			-		Resource of no value, LIQUIDATE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-			@<name>,@@	Resource holds no value, allocate as specified
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
